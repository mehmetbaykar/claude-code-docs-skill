# Work with Claude Tag

> Claude Tag puts Claude in your Slack channels with admin-governed access. See what to hand it, how setup works, and where to start as an admin or end user.

Public Beta
Tag @Claude in. Get results back in the thread.
Anyone in a Slack channel can tag Claude into a problem and hand it work: reproduce a bug and open a pull request, turn a decision thread into a doc, assemble the state of a project. It posts a checklist in the thread as it goes, and the whole exchange stays visible to the channel.

On it. I'll compare latency before and after the deploy, track down the cause, and report back here.


Done: Pulled p99 latency from Datadog
Done: Diffed deploy 4f2c1 against main
Done: Reproduced the slow query locally
In progress: Opening a pull request with the fix…


## Plans that include Claude Tag

Claude Tag is available on Team and Enterprise plans, on Anthropic's first-party service. It isn't available on individual plans (Free, Pro, or Max), or for third-party deployments. To use it, your organization pairs its Slack workspace with its Claude organization; see [the setup overview](https://code.claude.com/docs/claude-tag/admins/setup-overview) for the full prerequisites.

If you're choosing between Claude products for Slack-shaped work, [how Claude Tag differs from Cowork and Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/claude-tag/concepts/how-it-works#how-claude-tag-differs-from-cowork-and-claude-code) compares them directly: team work in shared channels is Claude Tag; personal work on your own files is Cowork or Claude Code.

### Who needs a Claude seat

Slack users don't each need a Claude seat to work with Claude in channels.

* **In channels**: by default, anyone in the paired Slack workspace can tag `@Claude` in a channel, and an Owner can [restrict who can use Claude](https://code.claude.com/docs/claude-tag/admins/restrict-access#restrict-who-can-use-claude) to people in your Claude organization or, on Enterprise, to specific roles. Channel work bills by usage to your organization's usage balance, under a [spend limit](https://code.claude.com/docs/claude-tag/admins/set-spend-limit) an Owner sets.
* **In group DMs**: the same restriction on who can use Claude applies, and the work bills to your organization's usage balance. See [Group DMs](https://code.claude.com/docs/claude-tag/admins/restrict-access#group-dms).
* **In one-to-one DMs**: a DM from a member who has connected a Claude account runs on that account and bills to that person's seat. The seat must include Claude Code, or, on the Enterprise plan, be a **Standard** or **Usage-Based Chat** seat held by someone who also has Cowork. A [DM from a member who hasn't connected a Claude account](https://code.claude.com/docs/claude-tag/admins/restrict-access#direct-messages-from-members-without-a-claude-account) can bill to your organization for a limited time.

## Where Claude Tag runs

Claude Tag works in Slack. You interact with it by writing in a Slack channel, thread, or direct message, and it replies there. Mention `@Claude` in a channel to guarantee it picks the message up.

When Claude works on a task, it runs in an ephemeral sandbox, not on your computer. The sandbox is created when a conversation starts, holds any code or files Claude is working with, and is discarded when the conversation goes idle. See [how Claude Tag works](https://code.claude.com/docs/claude-tag/concepts/how-it-works) for the full lifecycle.

You extend what Claude can reach, like your repositories, ticketing systems, data warehouses, and custom tools, through [connections](https://code.claude.com/docs/claude-tag/admins/add-connections), [plugins, and skills](https://code.claude.com/docs/claude-tag/admins/customize). An Owner or a [Claude Tag admin](https://code.claude.com/docs/claude-tag/admins/restrict-access#delegate-claude-tag-administration) configures these per scope (a channel, a workspace, or the whole organization). Members' own claude.ai connectors are separate from that configuration; Claude can use them in a channel for the member's own requests, as [personal connectors in channels](https://code.claude.com/docs/claude-tag/concepts/personal-connectors) describes.

## Billing and spend limits

Adding Claude to Slack doesn't add a per-seat charge. Channel, thread, and group DM work is billed by usage instead: it draws from a **usage balance**, an amount in your organization's billing currency that an Owner funds. A [spend limit](https://code.claude.com/docs/claude-tag/admins/set-spend-limit) caps how much of that balance Claude Tag can use each billing period.

One-to-one direct messages from members who have connected a Claude account don't draw from this balance. Such a DM runs on the sender's own claude.ai account and follows that seat's usual usage limits, so the organization spend limit doesn't apply to it. A [DM from a member who hasn't connected a Claude account](https://code.claude.com/docs/claude-tag/admins/restrict-access#direct-messages-from-members-without-a-claude-account) can draw from this balance.

To learn what your team's usage costs, run a pilot with a spend limit set and watch the per-channel breakdown on the [usage page in your admin settings](https://claude.ai/admin-settings/usage/claude-tag). [Set a spend limit](https://code.claude.com/docs/claude-tag/admins/set-spend-limit) covers how to fund the balance on each plan, set the limit, and what happens when usage reaches it.

For end users

## Put Claude Tag to work

If Claude Tag is in your channel, you can use it now. (If it isn't there yet, an Owner in your Claude organization runs setup: see [Set up Claude Tag](https://code.claude.com/docs/claude-tag/admins/setup-overview).) Anyone in the channel can hand it work, and channel work bills to the organization, not to you.

What it can reach starts with the channel you're in. The fastest way to find out is to ask it: `@Claude what can you access from this channel?` Or, if you're signed in to your Claude organization, click **Configure** in the footer of a Claude reply in the channel to see its [connections](https://code.claude.com/docs/claude-tag/concepts/glossary#connection), the external services an admin has connected for that channel. Replies in org-shared channels have no Configure link.

For your own requests, Claude can also [use the connectors on your claude.ai account](https://code.claude.com/docs/claude-tag/concepts/personal-connectors), after you allow it.

In a one-to-one DM, Claude runs on your own claude.ai account instead of a channel's setup. Owners can disable DMs organization-wide; see [Allow or disable direct messages](https://code.claude.com/docs/claude-tag/admins/restrict-access#allow-or-disable-direct-messages).

### Common uses

Each link opens a guide with the prompts to paste and the connections the task needs.

* [Watch monitors and alerts](https://code.claude.com/docs/claude-tag/users/use-cases/watch-monitors): scheduled dashboard checks, and alerts investigated as they arrive. Needs a monitoring connection like Datadog, Sentry, or PagerDuty.
* [Triage requests](https://code.claude.com/docs/claude-tag/users/use-cases/triage-requests): an intake channel where Claude answers what it can, flags duplicates, and routes the rest. Works on Slack content alone.
* [Find answers in your docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/claude-tag/users/use-cases/find-answers): policy and runbook questions answered with the source. Needs a docs connection like Google Drive, Notion, or Confluence.
* [Answer data questions](https://code.claude.com/docs/claude-tag/users/use-cases/answer-data-questions): a plain-language question becomes a warehouse query and a chart. Needs a data warehouse connection.
* [Track projects and chase approvals](https://code.claude.com/docs/claude-tag/users/use-cases/track-projects): standing status digests and follow-ups that run until an approval lands
* [Turn threads into docs and tickets](https://code.claude.com/docs/claude-tag/users/use-cases/create-artifacts): a settled discussion becomes the decision doc, the customer reply, or the filed tickets
* [Fix bugs](https://code.claude.com/docs/claude-tag/users/use-cases/fix-bugs): a bug reported in the channel comes back as a draft pull request. Needs GitHub.
* [Work from your own channel](https://code.claude.com/docs/claude-tag/users/use-cases/your-own-channel): scratch questions, digests of channels you don't follow, and follow-ups on what you said you'd do

[Get started](https://code.claude.com/docs/claude-tag/users/getting-started) covers your first message, what you see while Claude works, and how to shape Claude's behavior in your channel.

For administrators

## Set Claude Tag up once for everyone

You set up Claude Tag once, at [`claude.ai/admin-settings/claude-tag`](https://claude.ai/admin-settings/claude-tag), and you must be an Owner in your Claude organization to do it. The setup page at that URL walks you through it:

* **Pair your Slack workspace**: send `@Claude connect` in Slack to get a pairing code, then enter it on the setup page.
* **Set a monthly spend limit, add Claude to channels, and launch**.

Once you launch, everyone in a channel Claude is in can use Claude Tag immediately, with no per-user setup.

Claude Tag starts with no access of its own to your external systems. After you launch, you connect the services Claude will work in, such as your issue tracker or data warehouse, and grant repositories to the Claude GitHub App. The services you connect form an [Access bundle](https://code.claude.com/docs/claude-tag/concepts/glossary#access-bundle), the set of tools Claude can reach. You attach the bundle to a workspace or to channels. Members can also let Claude use their own [personal connectors](https://code.claude.com/docs/claude-tag/concepts/personal-connectors) for their requests.

[Set up Claude Tag](https://code.claude.com/docs/claude-tag/admins/setup-overview) walks through setup and connecting tools, with what to have ready, what each choice means, and how to verify Claude Tag works once you launch.
