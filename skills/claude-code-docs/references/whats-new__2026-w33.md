# Week 33 · August 10–14, 2026

> Claude Code Desktop auto-continues after a usage limit resets, fork mode turns on by default, and GitLab merge requests and marketplaces join GitHub.

Releases [v2.1.225 → v2.1.233](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/changelog#2-1-225)
3 features · August 10–14

Auto-continue after a usage limit on Desktop
Desktop


When you hit your session limit in the Code tab of Claude Code Desktop, the limit card now offers an **Auto-continue when limits reset** checkbox. Check it, and the Desktop app retries the interrupted turn after the reset. The card shows the retry time. The weekly-limit card doesn't offer it.

The next time a session-limit card appears, check **Auto-continue when limits reset** and leave the session open. The card shows `Auto-resuming at` followed by the reset time, and the turn picks up on its own once the limit resets.

Fork mode on by default
v2.1.232


Fork mode is now on by default in interactive sessions. Claude can request the `fork` subagent type, which inherits the full conversation and prompt cache instead of starting fresh, so you don't have to re-explain the context for a side task. Subagents Claude spawns in interactive sessions, apart from the ones an agent-team teammate spawns, also run in the background by default.

Start a fork yourself with a task that needs everything you've discussed so far:
```text Claude Code
  > /subtask draft unit tests for the parser changes so far
```

The fork appears in the panel below your prompt and its result arrives in your conversation when it finishes. To turn fork mode off, set `CLAUDE\_CODE\_FORK\_SUBAGENT=0`.

GitLab merge requests and marketplaces
v2.1.232


Plugin marketplaces clone bare `gitlab.com` URLs, including nested subgroups. On v2.1.233 or later, pass a GitLab merge request URL to `--worktree` to branch from it, and the `claude agents` view labels sessions linked to a merge request as `!N`. Claude Code also redacts GitLab token families such as `glpat-` and `glrt-`, and protects the `glab` CLI's config store the same way it protects `gh`.

Start a session in a worktree branched from a merge request:
```bash
  claude --worktree https://gitlab.com/group/project/-/merge_requests/42
```

When `origin` is on gitlab.com, Claude Code fetches `merge-requests/42/head` and opens the session on that branch in its own worktree.

Other wins

Type `@` in the prompt to [mention another Claude session](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/cross-session-messaging#message-another-session) by name, and Claude messages it directly with `SendMessage`; a bare name that matches exactly one live session now delivers without a confirmation step
Interactive sessions on one machine keep [unique names](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/cross-session-messaging#see-which-sessions-claude-can-reach): if you start or rename a session with a name another live session already uses, Claude Code gives yours a `name-word-word` variant and tells you
Plugin marketplaces accept [command sources](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces#command-sources): a local command prints the plugin directory, which Claude Code re-resolves each session and applies without a restart
On Linux and WSL, set [CLAUDE\_CODE\_TOOL\_MEMORY\_LIMIT](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/tools-reference#memory-limit-on-linux-and-wsl) to a size such as `4G` to cap the memory Bash and PowerShell tool commands can use
The task-tracking tools, such as `TaskCreate`, `TaskUpdate`, and `TodoWrite`, are [no longer available on Opus 4.8, Sonnet 5, Fable 5, Mythos 5, and later models in those families](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/tools-reference#task-tool-availability); set `CLAUDE\_CODE\_ENABLE\_TODO\_TOOLS=1` to re-enable them
[/code-review](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/code-review#review-a-diff-locally) at high, xhigh, and max effort now runs in a background agent like the other levels
[/plugin install plugin\@marketplace](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/discover-plugins#install-plugins) refreshes the marketplace first, so newly published plugins install without a manual marketplace update
Settings accept [additionalMarketplaces and allowedMarketplaces](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings-reference#marketplace-key-aliases) as aliases for `extraKnownMarketplaces` and `strictKnownMarketplaces`
On newer models, Claude can [overwrite an existing file with the Write tool](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/tools-reference#write-tool-behavior) without reading it first this session, matching the Edit tool's rules; older models require the read
The VS Code extension can [organize the sessions list into groups](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/vs-code#organize-sessions-into-groups): right-click to create, rename, or delete a group, and Cmd/Ctrl- or Shift-click to move several sessions at once
If your organization routes Claude Code through a [Claude apps gateway with spend limits](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/claude-apps-gateway-spend-limits), Claude Code shows the limit period, its reset time, and the operator's message when you reach the limit
